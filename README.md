Glinski's Hexagonal Chess played in the browser.

Glinski's Hexagonal Chess is a variation on standard chess, played on a hexagonal board with slightly different rules. While this version does not yet detect draws - which I hope to add the capability to do so soon - it is fully developed in every other way. 

If you have never played hexagonal chess before, you can read about the rules from this Wikipedia page - [Hexagonal chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess) - or from the CGP Grey video recently published [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgR3yESAEVE). After all, hexagons are the bestagons!
